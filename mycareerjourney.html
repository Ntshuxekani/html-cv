<p>I started job hunting last year october i was called for my first interview at Stallion company in Pretoria.</p>
<p> Went for my second interview at ProserveEOH in SunningHill.</p>
<p>My third interview was at CiTi powered by BCX, I was lucky there signed a 12 month contract, after two weeks before we started i received an email saying they rejected me i was devastated.</p>
It was during february this year i nearly gave up on applying for IT learnerships but having my family thet supported me i get back in tha game of applying bytes called me for an interview again i was lucky they told me they will email me the contract again i got a rejection.</p>
<p> I came across mLab post i applied they called me for an interview went there but all hope was gone until the day i received an acceptance email i was very happy indeed God works on his time.</p>
